# Food Delivery App

A Flutter-based food delivery application that allows users to view food items, add them to the cart, and proceed to order summary and checkout. This project uses state management and provides a smooth and interactive UI.

## Features

### Home Screen
- Displays a list of food items retrieved from a provided JSON file or API endpoint.
- Each food item displays:
  - Name
  - Image
  - Price
  - "Add to Cart" button

### Cart Screen
- Displays a list of items added to the cart, including the total price.
- Users can:
  - Update the quantity of each item.
  - Remove an item from the cart.

### Order Summary Screen
- Displays order details, including selected items and the total cost.
- Users can confirm the order.

### Search Feature
- A global search bar to search food items by name.

### Bonus Features (Optional but Encouraged)
- **State Management:** Use **Riverpod**, **Provider**, or **Bloc** for efficient state handling.
- **UI/UX Design:** Custom animations and widgets for a polished UI.
- **Persistent Cart:** Saves cart data locally so it remains available after app restart.
